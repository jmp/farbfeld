"""
Module for working with the farbfile image format.

This module can be used to reading or writing pixel data from/to farbfeld
image files. For reading and writing, use the functions 'read' and 'write',
respectively.

The image format consists of the bytes 'farbfeld' followed by the
image width and height as 32-bit unsigned big-endian integers. After
these, the actual image data is of length width*height and consists
of four-component (RGBA) pixels, each component being 16-bit unsigned
big-endian integers.

To read a farbfile image:

>>> with open('image.ff', 'rb') as f:
...     data = read(f)

This will return the pixels as a nested list: the first list contains
the pixels on the first row, the second list contains the second row,
and so on. Each pixels is in turn a list containing four components.

Note that the pixel components are 16-bit unsigned integers, so the
values are between 0 and 65535. For visualizing the image, you may
want to scale the values to the [0, 1] or [0, 255] range.

To write a farbfeld image:

>>> with open('image.ff', 'wb') as f:
...     write(f, data)

The data should be given in the same format as returned by the 'read'
function (i.e. a nested list). If the format is not correct, an
exception will be raised.
